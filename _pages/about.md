# About Me        
* I am a Ph.D. student at [EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). Before joining Umich, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Washington, majoring in Mathematics, followed by a Master's degree from NYU with a major in Data Science.

* My research interests lie in representation learning, specifically, finding and utilizing low-dimensional structures and dynamics of deep networks. Besides, I'm also interested in robust deep learning, and Super-resolution microspcopy.
